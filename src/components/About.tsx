      <p className="mb-4 text-xl md:text-2xl">
        I&apos;m a 3rd-year Networking & IT student at Ontario Tech University
        and a Network Engineering Intern at CBC, where I help migrate the
        standard LAN to a Cisco SDA network. I enjoy tackling challenges through
        personal projects and always look for learning opportunities, whether
        through hands-on experiences or certifications. When I&apos;m not at my
        desk, I&apos;m usually at the gym, trying out new food, or hanging out
        with friends and family.
