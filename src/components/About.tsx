        “I'm a 3rd-year Networking & IT student at Ontario Tech University and a
        Network Engineering Intern at CBC, where I help migrate the standard LAN
        network to Cisco SDA. I love tackling challenges through personal
        projects and always look for ways to learn more, whether through
        hands-on projects or certifications. When I'm not at my desk, I'm
        usually at the gym, trying out new foods, or hanging out with friends
        and family.”
