      <p className="mb-4 text-xl md:text-2xl">
        I'm a 3rd-year Networking & IT student at Ontario Tech University and a
        Network Engineering Intern at CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation),
        where I assist in migrating the standard LAN network to Cisco SDA. I
        have a passion for problem-solving through personal projects and
        continuously expanding my knowledge through certifications. When I'm not
        at my desk, you can find me at the gym, trying new foods, or spending
        time with friends and family.
